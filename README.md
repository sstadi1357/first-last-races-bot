# first-last-races-bot
First Last Races bot that has all the functionality of First/Last Races. Most code is commented so you will understand. If you don't, ask ai to explain it to you. This is private, so if you're looking at this, your name is Shaehan Tadiparthi and you either lost your files for the bot or they disappeared. Make sure to put all of this in a folder and install node.js, discord.js, and pm2. Also, this bot only works if the flair announcements channel is "flair-announcements," and the main channel to get points is "general-races." This is not made for all servers yet.
